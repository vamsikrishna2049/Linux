To automate the process of downgrading packages on a Debian-based system (such as Ubuntu) to their previous versions. The script works by parsing the APT history logs to identify upgraded packages, extracting the previous versions, and then attempting to downgrade those packages to their previous versions.

**1. Log Parsing:**
The script reads through /var/log/apt/history.log to find entries where packages were upgraded.
It then extracts the names of the upgraded packages and their previous versions.

**2. Package Downgrade:**
For each upgraded package, the script checks if the previous version is still available in the repository.
If the previous version is found, the script attempts to downgrade the package to that version using apt install <package>=<previous_version>.
If the previous version is not available, the script outputs a message and skips the downgrade for that package.

**3. Interactive Operations:**
The script doesn't directly ask for confirmation from the user before downgrading, as it operates automatically based on the historical log data. It proceeds with downgrades wherever applicable.

**4. Handling Edge Cases:**
If there is any issue with parsing or identifying a package's previous version, it skips the downgrade and outputs a warning message.
If a package's previous version is not available in the repository, the script skips the downgrade attempt and notifies the user.

**Use Case:**
This script could be useful in environments where a package upgrade causes issues, and administrators want to revert packages to their previous versions automatically based on their APT upgrade history.
