To remove all installed packages from your Linux system, you can use the package manager specific to your distribution.
The commands differ depending on whether you are using a Debian-based system (e.g., Ubuntu) or a Red Hat-based system (e.g., CentOS, Fedora). 

Note: 
Be extremely cautious when using these commands, as they will remove all installed packages, including critical system components. 
Make sure you have a proper backup and understand the consequences before proceeding. This action could render your system unusable.

----------------------------------------
For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu):
----------------------------------------
Open a terminal and run the following commands one by one:

1. Update the package list:
   sudo apt update -y

2. Mark all packages as automatically installed (to avoid removing crucial packages):
   sudo apt-mark auto $(apt list --installed | cut -d/ -f1)

3. Remove all installed packages (except the essential ones marked as manually installed):
   sudo apt autoremove --purge -y 

-------------------------------------------------
For Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora):
-------------------------------------------------
Open a terminal and run the following command:

1. Remove all installed packages (excluding the essential ones):
   sudo dnf remove $(rpm -qa)

Important: Before running any of these commands, ensure you have taken a backup of your important data and configurations. 
Removing all installed packages is a drastic action that should only be used in specific circumstances, 
such as when you want to start with a clean slate or are planning to reinstall the operating system. Be sure to understand the implications of this action and proceed with caution
